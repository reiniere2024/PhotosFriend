Hi All,

In the Past we had small amounts of photos carefully stored in precious books that we
kept securely and showed to everyone. Nowadays we have streams of pictures spread out
over apple devices but noone sees them anymore and they get lost when the device space 
is used up or a new apple device is bought.

It is time to step out of this stupid process of photo devaluation and begin organizing
your photos again so that you will be able to show your old photos later on as the
precious witnesses of earlier stages of you and your family's life.

With PhotosFriend you can organize all your photos. First make all categories you want
to use for your archive and then load all photos into your archive. Folders and photos
can be (re)named viewed sized rotated and reformatted and kept forever.

When you open the solution in Visual Studio 2008 then don't forget to move the maps xml,log 
and picts to the bin/debug directory when you want to run the code.

Good luck,
Reiniere.

NOTE:
When you are blocked from viewing the contents on the C:\-folder at the start of the
program "Archive Photos" then please start the program as Administrator.
